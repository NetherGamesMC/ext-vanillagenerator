# noiselib
PHP Extension for VanillaGenerator noise written in C++. There is some negligible floating point error which sometimes
resulting in an unexpected natural world generation error, for example water is being generated underneath a tree.

## Performance impact
These are the total recorded values for every `generateChunk()` function that gets called in an async task. To summarize, noiselib is 40% faster than the original noise written in PHP.

| Scenario | Without noiselib | With noiselib |
| :-----: | :-------: | :---------: |
| Without JIT | ~140ms | ~80ms |
| With JIT | ~70ms | ~50ms |
